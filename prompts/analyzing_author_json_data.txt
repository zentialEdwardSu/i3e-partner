You will receive a JSON file containing a list of publications.
Your task is to **classify these publications by research direction** and then **generate a Markdown file (.md)**, **not just print Markdown characters as plain text**.

The Markdown file should follow this structure:

1. **First-level headings (`#`)**: Represent the **main research directions**.

   * For each main direction, write a short paragraph introducing and explaining its importance.
   * Example: treat *Over-the-Air Computation* as a main direction, **not** just "Wireless Communication."

2. **Second-level headings (`##`)**: Represent the **sub-directions** within each main direction.

   * Provide a short introduction for each sub-direction.
   * Example: within *Over-the-Air Computation*, sub-directions can be *Waveform Design* or *Beamforming*.

3. **Publication listing**: Under each sub-direction, use an unordered list (`-`) to display the publications.
   Each item must include:

   * **Title** of the paper
   * **Author list**
   * **One or two key contributions** (summarized in your own words)

4. **Output requirements**:

   * Always **generate a Markdown file** with a `.md` extension (not just inline Markdown text).
   * Choose a meaningful filename for the `.md` file.
   * Do not omit any publications.
